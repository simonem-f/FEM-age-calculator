## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

My first React App ever 🙂 so I chose a simple application to experiment with React basic concepts, no other libraries added, form elements are standard html inputs / button styled.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

My purpose was to get my hands dirty with React, not very difficult with a small and simple application like this one.
Form binding and validation was a bit more complex than I thought, Angular double binding is really handy.
I struggled a bit with spacing (font and padding sizes) maybe my code doesn't 100% match with mock-ups, and also age calculation was a bit tricky initially.

### Continued development

I didn't came up with a custom solution for the counter animation yet, my next goal is to find an implementation from-scratch without external packages.
